- **Game Reset**: Start over from scratch at any time.

## Tech Stack

## How to Play

1.  Click **Start Game** to be dealt your first two cards.
2.  Choose to **Hit** to receive another card or **Stand** to keep your current hand.
3.  The dealer will then play their turn according to standard Blackjack rules (hitting until their score is 17 or higher).
4.  The winner is determined, and you can choose to **Play Again**.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm install
```

Navigate to the next_2025 folder.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
